Problem with most codebases

1. No consistency
    -> Fix that with having themes folder for Icons, Fonts

2. Too many duplicate code
    -> Fix that by having a static & animations folder with the most common widgets

3. Tablet optimization
    -> Cya is tackling that issue in the same codebase with the .t tag
        Theree must be a better way of doing it

4. No testing
    -> Need to intergrate devops, and push releases this way as apk to test 
    -> Need to write common test cases for each layout
    -> Need to test every single version

5. Complex state management
    -> Use set state or getX




Consider a config setup one time
back on scaffold android shouldnt happen
swipe on ios shouldn't happen
